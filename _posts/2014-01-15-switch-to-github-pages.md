Today I switched from my former vps + django setup to github + jekyll aka [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).


Main reasons in no particular order:

* no security updates
* no worries about crashing servers
* no server costs
* no need for any dynamic content
* highly available through github cdn
* something new to learn

I regret nothing and am really impressed about another awesome Github feature!
