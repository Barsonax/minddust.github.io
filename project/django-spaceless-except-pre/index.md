`spaceless_except_pre` is a template-tag that strips out any whitespaces and line returns (like the Django's [spaceless](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#spaceless) template-tag) **but** preserves all formatting between `<pre>` tags. This could be very usefull (and essential) if you want to minify your content and preserve code indention and spacing.
